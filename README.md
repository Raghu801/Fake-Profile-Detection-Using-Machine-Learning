# Fake-Profile-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

1. Data Acquisition: Collect all data related to fake and genuine user profiles. Ensure the dataset includes a balanced representation of fake and genuine profiles.

2. Under-sampling: Balance the datasets of fake and genuine users by under-sampling. This ensures that the classifier isn't biased towards the majority class.

3. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Transform the dataset into a clean, standardized format suitable for analysis.

4. Feature Engineering: Manipulate, add, delete, and mutate features to enhance model performance. Extract meaningful features from raw data, enhancing statistical data to support the machine learning model.

5. KNN Model Selection: Implement the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm as the classifier. Utilize KNN to distinguish between fake and genuine profiles.

6. Result: The KNN classifier successfully predicted whether profiles were fake or genuine. These predictions were made based on the trained KNN model, providing insights into the classification of user profiles in the dataset.
